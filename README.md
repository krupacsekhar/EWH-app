# Akafuba

## Background
**Akafuba Educational Program** is a simple, easy to understand, innovative approach to breaking barriers
of stigma, fear, myths and misconceptions of TB.

Our primary goal with the education program is to address the lack of understanding about TB and
improve knowledge of the disease, symptoms, prevention, and treatment so that the occurrence of TB
can be reduced substantially.

The **Akafuba Educational Program** will run on an android tablet that has been successfully used as an
education tool since its introduction into Ugandaâ€™s rural communities in 2018. The program runs offline
internet, features simple graphics and limited text as the lesson is taught in the local dialect by a Rose
Uganda Fellow. Workshops are generally taught in a relaxed environment in a group setting. The
lessons taught are designed to encourage:

- Improved knowledge about TB and its transmission
- How to improve health to prevent TB
- Discussion about myths and misconceptions
- Improved understanding about early diagnosis and treatment

The **Akafuba Educational Program** aims to reduce the fear of the unknown about TB, by teaching how
the disease is spread and most importantly how to prevent TB transmission by improving healthy
choices, nutrition and sanitation.

## Additional Information
This was created by Cornell's Engineering World Health team, in which I am a developer and designer.
Through weekly deliverables, I created the JSON file layout, developed the content screen, and the about 
screen, as well as implementing small fixes in other screens along the way.
